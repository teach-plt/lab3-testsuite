```
$ tar -zxf lab3-testsuite.tar.gz
```

+ Enter the ``lab3-testsuite`` directory:
```
$ cd lab3-testsuite
```

+ Compile the test program using ``make`` or alternatively:
```
$ ghc -threaded --make -o plt-test-lab3 plt-test-lab3.hs
```


= Running the testsuite =

This is what you need to do to test your solution.


+ Enter the ``lab3-testsuite`` directory (if you are not there already):
```
$ cd lab3-testsuite
```

+ Run ``plt-test-lab3`` with the path to the directory
where your solution is located:

```
$ ./plt-test-lab3 path/to/your/solution/
```
